# Multiplex synthesis

This repository contains all the source codes for data analysis in the multiplex synthesis paper.

Multiplex synthesis MS/MS libraries can be downloaded from [here](https://external.gnps2.org/gnpslibrary).

MS/MS libraries were generated using the [reverse metabolomics library generation pipeline](https://gnps2.org/workflowinput?workflowname=reverse_metabolomics_create_library_workflow). The codebase of this workflow can be found [here](https://github.com/Wang-Bioinformatics-Lab/Reverse_metabolomics_library_generation).
